# Kalman\'s Kit

Kalman\'s Kit is a low cost educational robotics kit designed to help users learn about robot construction, micro-ROS, and ROS2 concepts. The kit features a differential drive robot with autonomous navigation capabilities, making it an excellent tool for hands-on learning in robotics.

My role in this project involved integrating the software components of the kit, specifically focusing on micro-ROS and ROS2.
